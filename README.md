# Sauerbraten Community Edition Client #


Welcome to the Sauerbraten Community Edition!
A client inspired by the Community.


## What is this, just another client? 

No this is not another client for Sauerbraten. Think of it, as your own client. Sauerbraten has been around for years, but a lot of desired features are lacking, many of which could be easy implemented. 
Other games allow the players to customise the game environment a lot more than Sauerbraten does, which is a shame for an opensource game. This project aims to open the game to more customisation to suit the individual gamestyle of any player, making options accessible which the community desires. 
This client won't be an effort of one person, but we invite the whole community to contribute. Whether with ideas or with actual written codelines, all is welcome. 

Ofcourse, this asks the question where one draws the line between feature and an unfair advantage? The aim of the community edition is to raise the level of competitive gaming in sauerbraten but stay as close to the souce as possible. We don't intend to change the physics or weapon options, although we let this idea open for a possible follwoing Pro Edition with a new protocol version, so that this won't interferr with the original Sauerbraten, gameplay.
All changes are being discussed on the [Sauerworld Forums](http://forum.sauerworld.org "Forum") and we encourage the whole community to take part in this process.
